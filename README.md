For this project, I utilized lists to randomly select a word from the word file and to verify the validity of the player's input. While it would have been equally effective to use an array for the word file, given that the size of the file is fixed and the access time for both lists and arrays is O(1), the choice between the two data structures doesn't matter as much. However, it should be noted that utilizing a hash map, with words as keys, would be a more optimal solution for word lookup due to the O(1) access time.
